/**
 * A fake Roam backend, installed by patching `globalThis.fetch`.
 *
 * Loaded with `node --import ./test/fake-roam-backend.mjs build/index.js` so it
 * is in place before the server initialises any graph. The Roam SDK reaches the
 * network through exactly one path — `fetch(request)` against
 * https://api.roamresearch.com — so intercepting that gives the real server a
 * real graph connection whose backend happens to be this fixture.
 *
 * WHY NOT MOCK THE OPERATION CLASSES: because that is precisely the gap that
 * let the hide filter ship broken. Unit tests proved `pruneHiddenBlocks` worked
 * and proved the schemas carried annotations; nothing proved a `tools/call`
 * reached either one. This fixture keeps the whole stack — HTTP transport, MCP
 * routing, graph resolution, operation classes, SDK — and fakes only the wire.
 *
 * Queries are dispatched by matching distinctive substrings of the Datalog,
 * which is brittle by nature. That is deliberate: if a read path changes its
 * query shape, this returns nothing and the test fails loudly rather than
 * quietly passing against a mock that was updated in lockstep.
