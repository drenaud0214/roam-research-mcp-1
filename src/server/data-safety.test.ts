/**
 * The two channels through which the server warns a client about writes that
 * destroy content:
 *
 *   1. `roam_get_guidelines` carries `roamSyntax` — the rules a model needs
 *      before its first write, on a response it already asks for.
 *   2. `roam_fetch_page_by_title` with `format: "structure"` marks the entries
 *      whose `text` is a truncated preview, because the format's whole purpose
 *      invites feeding those entries straight back into an update.
 *
 * Both are only worth anything if they survive to the wire, which is why they
 * are tested here rather than against the operation classes. A constant that
 * exists and a field that reaches a client are different claims, and the
 * second one is the one that matters.
